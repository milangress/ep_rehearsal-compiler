## What is ep_rehearsal_compiler?
An Etherpad Plugin to apply the ep_rehearsal_compiler functionality in a pad. (describe in minimum 50 Letters what it is)
Currently supports:
* ep_rehearsal_compiler functionality 1
* ep_rehearsal_compiler functionality 2
* ep_rehearsal_compiler functionality 3
* ep_rehearsal_compiler functionality 4

## ep_rehearsal_compiler Usage
Experimental.  As a special attribute on Etherpad, some weirdness may be experienced by using ep_rehearsal_compiler.

## ep_rehearsal_compiler History
I decided to copy/paste the ep_t3 over ep_rehearsal_compiler to create that plugin.
